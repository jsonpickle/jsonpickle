# What is this? A new file has been created. Also, note that the working directory
# is not the same as the one the exploit.py file is in. The json data changed the

# In essence, I can do anything with the system with the json data and exploit
# my victim's computer as evident from the example above. It would only be smart
# to only unpickle data that you know is absolutely secure. Currently, the only way to
# exploit json pickle is through the __reduce__ method. However, once the __reduce__
# method is given along with some malicious code, it is game over for the victim.
# You can find the malicious json in exploit.json
