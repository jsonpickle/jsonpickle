    * Switch build from setuptools to distutils
    * Consistent dictionary key ordering
    * Fix areas with improper support for unpicklable=False
    * Added support for cyclical data structures (`#16 
      <https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/issues/16>`_).
    * Experimental support for  `jsonlib <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/jsonlib/>`_

    .. warning::

        To support cyclical data structures (`#16 
        <https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/issues/16>`_), the storage format
        has been modified.  Efforts have been made to ensure backwards-compatibility.
        jsonpickle 0.4.0 can read data encoded by jsonpickle 0.3.1, but earlier
        versions of jsonpickle may be unable to read data encoded by jsonpickle 
        0.4.0.

---------------------------------

    * Include tests and docs directories in sdist for distribution packages.

Version 0.3.0 - December 11, 2009
---------------------------------

    * Officially migrated to git from subversion. Project home now at
