Examples
========

jsonpickle's GitHub includes an ``examples`` directory. In it, you can find
short example scripts that demonstrate various features. Each script is meant
to show one feature in an intuitive way, whether it relates to a real-world
situation (like buying bus tickets) or a job requirement (like building and
saving a pandas business report). All examples can be run locally as standalone
scripts that you can build off of.

The examples directory was made for people considering using jsonpickle to see
usage in practice as well as to show how various options can be used in more
concrete contexts compared to a short 2-line snippet in the docstring.

The examples are hosted in the GitHub repository:
